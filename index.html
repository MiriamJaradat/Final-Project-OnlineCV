            Hi, i'm Miriam, it's nice to meet you. On this page i have decided to write some 
            random things about me, both from a professional and a personal point of view. I feel
            that all aspects are important when deciding to bring a new person into your company, 
            or hire him/her for an independent project.

          Here you can find some details of the schools and universities i attended and their 
          specializations and also information about my current and former jobs. A few extra 
          words would be that i have had other smaller, summer type jobs which were not 
          neccessarily important enough to be mentioned here.

          projects. I have also mendtioned other courses and qualifications that i got to obtain

          I strongly believe it's really important for each person to have at least one hobby, 
          one passion they truly care about and for which they would always make an effort and 
          which would mentain them healthy and happy. I have many things that i love doing, but 
          here i mentioned the two biggest ones.
